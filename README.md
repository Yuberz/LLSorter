A Love Live Character true round robin Sorter written in Python 3.13.

## Features
- Every character from Î¼'s to Ikizurai-Bu!

## Caveats
- True round robin takes an immense amount of comparisons (1953 comparisons!)
- Some characters do not have data for blood type (they are ignored on data displays)
- Rival group characters are not included.

## TODO
- Maybe add the rival groups (would take only a few minutes but I'm lazy)
- Maybe add supporting characters
- Find a way to repurpose code to host online
